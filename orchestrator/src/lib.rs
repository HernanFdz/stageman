//! The deciding: watch the channels, judge what is worth acting on, and create
//! jobs.
//!
//! A job is one possible reaction and not the only one: doing nothing, and
//! answering on the channel, are reactions too. Judging is the work here;
//! spawning is a consequence of one particular judgement.
//!
//! Two things live here and nowhere else. Every platform credential, because a
//! job that cannot hold one cannot leak one. And every kickoff prompt, because
//! a job executes instructions it did not write — which is what makes prompt
//! text reviewable in one place rather than scattered across the system.
//!
//! To judge at all, this crate runs an agent itself, the same way a job does
//! and through the same contract — one-shot and structured rather than a
//! session in a workspace.
//!
//! Both are load-bearing rather than tidy: see `docs/architecture.md` §2 for
//! the credential invariant and `docs/conventions.md` §4 for why prompts are
//! held to a test.
