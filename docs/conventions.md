# Conventions

**This is the file that differs.** `AGENTS.md` and the justfile are identical
across every project built from this gate, which is what makes them worth
learning once; everything particular to *this* project belongs here instead, so
that the shared half stays comparable and the local half stays findable.

It is the project's brief for whoever works on it next: orientation first, then
the rules nothing enforces mechanically. What the project *does* is in
`README.md` and is not repeated here — one fact in two files is where drift
starts.

Nothing outside this repository will ever rewrite any of it. `quality init`
creates a project and lets go — there is no version file, no sync, and no
update to wait for — so a stale claim here survives until somebody notices it.

**Each section says what belongs in it and starts empty.** That prose is a
standing rule, not a placeholder: it stays when the section fills up, because it
governs what gets added next. Only two things are disposable — the HTML-comment
example, and the `_(none yet)_` marker, which means nobody has written it rather
than that there is nothing to write. Append new sections at the end rather than
renumbering — a `§3` cited in a commit message or a code comment breaks
silently, and no check catches it.

## 1. Where to start reading

The order below is what every project scaffolded from this gate starts with. Add
a document, add its line here, in the same commit — an entry point nobody
maintains sends the next reader to a guess, and a guess is invisible to you: it
produces confident work built on the wrong model, with nothing in the output
saying so.

1. `README.md` — what this does, for whoever is deciding whether to use it.
2. `docs/vision.md` — what it is for and what it refuses to be. Read before
   deciding what to build.
3. `docs/architecture.md` — the pieces, the invariants, and why this shape.
   Read before changing code.
4. `docs/decisions/` — the choices already taken, each with its rejected
   alternative and what would make it wrong.
5. `docs/open-questions.md` — what is still undecided, and the intended next
   step.

Layout lives in `docs/architecture.md` §1 and is deliberately not repeated here.
This file is loaded into every session; that one is read when you are about to
move code. One fact, one home.

## 2. Vocabulary

The words this codebase uses and what each means *here*, including the ones it
deliberately does not use.

The highest-value section in this file and the most often skipped. Someone who
reaches for a plausible synonym writes code that reads correctly and names the
wrong thing — and review does not catch it precisely because it reads correctly.
Record the near-miss too: the term you rejected, and what it would have implied.

<!-- Example:
| term | means here |
|---|---|
| frame | one fixed-size unit on the wire. Never a UI frame; that is a "view". |
| session | a client's authenticated span. A database one is a "connection". |

## 3. House rules

Anything someone would otherwise get wrong: framework versions and their
gotchas, the error type this project uses, which module owns which concern, the
external contracts it has to honour, and the patterns that look reasonable and
are wrong here.

State the rule and the reason. A rule without its reason gets discarded the
first time it is inconvenient — usually correctly, because a rule nobody can
justify is usually obsolete.

<!-- Example:
- **Time is UTC at every boundary.** A local-time value never crosses a module
  edge; convert at the edge. Two of the first three bugs here were timezone
  shaped.
- **No trait objects on the decode path.** Static dispatch throughout. The one
  measured attempt cost more than the flexibility was worth.

## 4. Quality bar beyond the gate

`AGENTS.md` carries the bar the gate enforces mechanically. This is for the part
it cannot: what "done" means here, what must have a property test, what must
never panic even where the lints would allow it, what needs a benchmark before
it lands.

<!-- Example:
- A parser change lands with a property test, not only examples. Every parser
  bug found so far was a case nobody thought to write down.
- Anything on the decode path is benchmarked before and after. A 5% regression
  is a blocker, not a note.
